# SnapTools Additionals
This whole repository does not contain any interesting code, but just provides some additional data for [SnapTools](https://github.com/jaqxues/SnapTools). 

This repository now controls the APK Updating System, as the Firebase and Analytics systems have been disabled. I am planning to move every previous SnapTools server communication in the repository.

Feel free to contribute and help in updating and maintaining the SnapTools App.
